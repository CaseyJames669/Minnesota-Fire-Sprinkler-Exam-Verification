    "question": "What is 'Columning' in a dry pipe valve?",
    "answer": "When priming water level is too high, creating pressure that prevents the clapper from opening",
    "distractors": [
      "When the air pressure is too low",
      "When the valve trips accidentally",
      "When the accelerator fails"
    ],

    "code_text": "High priming water exerts hydraulic pressure on the top of the clapper, locking it shut."

    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Ball Drip' (Automatic Drain) valve on the FDC piping?",
    "answer": "To drain water between the check valve and the FDC to prevent freezing",
    "distractors": [
      "To drain the main riser",
      "To test the pump",

    "question": "If a dry pipe valve trips but water does not reach the inspector's test within 60 seconds, what is the issue?",
    "answer": "System volume is too large for the air/water supply (Needs an Accelerator)",
    "distractors": [
      "Water pressure is too high",
      "Air pressure is too low",

      "Inside the FDC itself",
      "It is not required",
